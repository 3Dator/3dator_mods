# 3dator_Belt_Bed
This is our Prototype Belt Bed. It works by printing on a conveyor belt.
The Motor is connected in parallel with the Heatbed and moves by reversing the current with an H Bridge.

This Thing is still in development, because it is still tricky to assemble.
It fits our Printbed as an easy swap in replacement.
